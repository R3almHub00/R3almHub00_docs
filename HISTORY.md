Plan: R3alm Hub - Centralized Platform for R3alm Ecosystem Applications

Before proceeding with implementation, I have a few clarifying questions:

CSV Data Source: The R3almEcosystemApplications.csv file mentioned in the requirements is not currently in the project. Do you have this file to provide, or should I create mock data for the 21 R3alm Ecosystem applications based on reasonable assumptions?

Bolt Database vs Local Storage: The requirements mention using local JSON storage (localStorage or lowdb), but a Bolt Database is already configured and available. Would you prefer to use Bolt Database for data persistence (recommended for production-ready features) or stick with local storage as specified?

Documentation Content: Should the documentation files (README, HISTORY, ROADMAP, etc.) for each application contain realistic mock content, or would you prefer placeholder text that can be populated later?

1. Project Foundation and Database Setup

Install additional required dependencies: React Router DOM, Zustand for state management, and sanitize-html for input sanitization
Configure Bolt Database schema with tables for users, applications, preferences, and documentation
Set up database initialization scripts with seed data for the 21 R3alm Ecosystem applications
Create TypeScript type definitions for all data models
Set up database helper functions and API layer for CRUD operations
2. Authentication System

Create authentication context with role-based access control
Build login page with centered form layout using cyan/blue gradient theme
Implement demo user login buttons with proper credential validation
Add error handling with styled Tailwind alerts
Create protected route wrapper for authenticated pages
Set up session management and token handling with Bolt Database Auth
3. Navigation and Layout Structure

Build collapsible left sidebar navigation component
Implement active route highlighting with cyan accents
Add responsive hamburger menu with slide-in animation for mobile
Create navigation items: Dashboard, Add Application (admin only), Settings, Logout
Design layout wrapper component with sidebar and main content area
Add smooth transition animations for menu collapse/expand
4. Dashboard Page

Create responsive card grid layout for displaying all 21 applications
Design application cards showing name, description, status badge, version, and last updated date
Implement search functionality with real-time filtering
Add status filter dropdown with Active, In Development, and Planned options
Make cards clickable with navigation to individual app detail pages
Add edit button overlay on cards visible only to admin users
Implement loading states and empty state handling
5. Application Detail Pages

Set up dynamic routing for individual application pages
Create tabbed or card-based interface for documentation sections
Build components for each documentation type: README, HISTORY, ROADMAP, API_DOCUMENTATION, USER_MANUAL, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CHANGELOG, SECURITY, AUTHORS, FAQ
Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for documentation content
Implement back button navigation to dashboard
Design breadcrumb navigation for better UX
Add smooth tab transitions and content loading states
6. Add/Edit Application Forms

Create admin-only add application form with all required fields
Build edit application modal/form for updating existing apps
Implement form validation with real-time error messages
Add success/error notifications using toast or alert components
Create form fields for name, description, status dropdown, version, and last updated date
Ensure form data persists to database with proper error handling
7. Settings Page

Build user preferences interface with theme toggle
Create notification settings controls
Implement real-time preference saving to database
Add form sections for different setting categories
Include success feedback when settings are saved
Make settings user-specific with proper data isolation
8. UI/UX and Theming

Configure Tailwind theme with cyan and blue color palette
Create dark theme as default with proper contrast ratios
Design reusable button, input, card, and badge components
Add hover effects and smooth transitions throughout
Implement loading spinners and skeleton screens
Ensure proper focus states for keyboard navigation
9. Accessibility and Responsiveness

Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
Implement keyboard navigation support across all components
Test color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 standards
Create mobile-first responsive layouts for all pages
Test on various viewport sizes: mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
Add screen reader friendly labels and descriptions
10. Data Population and Mock API

Parse and import the 21 applications from CSV into database
Generate realistic mock content for all documentation types
Create API endpoint simulators for GET, POST, and PUT operations
Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
Add request validation and sanitization
Set up initial demo user accounts with different permission levels
11. Testing and Refinement

Test all authentication flows including login and logout
Verify CRUD operations work correctly for applications
Test search and filter functionality on dashboard
Confirm admin-only features are properly restricted
Test responsive behavior on multiple device sizes
Verify all navigation paths and routing work correctly
Check accessibility with keyboard-only navigation
Summary

This plan creates a production-ready R3alm Hub platform with professional design and full functionality. The approach prioritizes using Bolt Database for robust data persistence, implements proper authentication with role-based access control, and delivers a polished dark-themed UI with cyan/blue gradients. The application will be fully responsive, accessible, and extensible for future R3alm Ecosystem applications. By building each feature systematically, we ensure a stable foundation before adding complexity, resulting in a professional dashboard worthy of the R3alm brand.

Important Note: I am currently in "plan" mode and can only analyze and plan changes. To implement this plan, please switch back to "build" mode using the "Implement this plan" button or by clicking the "Plan" button again.
